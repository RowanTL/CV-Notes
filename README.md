# Overview

These are notes taken from `Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications 2nd Edition`
by `Richard Szeliski`.

I cannot redistribute the work, but I can link to the book.

## How to read the notes

Use vscode to render the markdown.

There is KaTeX imbedded in the markdown so a standard renderer probably wont do.
